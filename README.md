* Work to be accomplished:
    * [] change to user-friendly function interface for facilitating external call
    * [] implement the python version


## Introduction
TD-AR6 features are employed as the sEMG feature and MSD features are employed as the A-mode ultrasound (AUS) feature.

## Environment
The codes are running with Matlab 2017b on Windows 10.

## Data preparing
We apply one sEMG sample and one AUS sample for code testing, which can be downloaded from:
